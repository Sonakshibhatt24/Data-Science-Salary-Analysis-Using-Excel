In the exploration of a data science salary dataset using MS Excel, the initial step involved importing clean data into pivot tables. The data was organized to summarize salaries based on relevant factors, such as experience and education. Pivot charts were then generated to visually depict salary trends and patterns. These charts were seamlessly integrated into a compact dashboard on a separate worksheet, presenting key salary metrics with optional dynamic controls for user interaction. The final stages encompassed reviewing and refining the dashboard layout to facilitate easy updates with the latest salary information.
